![Terminal Screenshot] ![Screenshot_2025-07-07_08_05_32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ae604e9-4080-478a-829b-136d3d97b39c)


## 1. 🎯 Project Goal

This project demonstrates the process of cracking password-protected ZIP files using a **dictionary attack** with **John the Ripper**. It highlights how weak password policies make data vulnerable and emphasizes the value of strong passwords in real-world scenarios.

> **Note**: This project is for **educational purposes only**.

## 2. 📘 What I Learned

- **ZIP File Security**: How ZIP files implement password protection.
- **Password Cracking Techniques**: Used `zip2john` to extract crackable hash data.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Learned the power and limitation of using `rockyou.txt`.
- **Security Policies**: Understood the role of password complexity in defense.

---

## 3. 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **OS**: Kali Linux / Ubuntu
- **Cracking Tool**: [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
- **Wordlist**: `rockyou.txt` (commonly used password list)
- **Utilities**:
  - `zip` (to create protected ZIPs)
  - `zip2john` (to extract hashes from ZIP)
  - `john` (to perform the actual cracking)

## 4. 🔬 Process and Methodology

### 🧾 Step 1: Create a ZIP File with a Password

```bash
echo "This is a secret file." > secret1.txt
echo "Another secret." > secret2.txt
zip --password password123 protected.zip secret1.txt secret2.txt

🔒 Understanding Weak vs. Strong Password Policies
🔻 Weak Password Policies
Common Characteristics:

Short passwords (e.g., under 8 characters).

Use of common words or simple patterns (password, 123456, qwerty).

Predictable sequences (e.g., abc123, Password1).

Lack of complex characters (no mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

Use of personal data (birthdays, pet names, etc.).

Examples of Weak Passwords:

password

123456

letmein

qwertyui

welcome

Risks & Vulnerabilities:

✅ Easily cracked by brute-force or dictionary attacks

✅ Susceptible to guessing or social engineering

✅ Often reused across multiple accounts (increasing breach impact)

✅ Strong Password Policies
Key Characteristics:

12–16+ characters in length.

Mixed character types: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special symbols.

No real words or recognizable patterns.

Different passwords for different services.

No personal or public user-related info.

Examples of Strong Passwords:

G7$k9@Lm2PqR

Tb9#zX1vW2mN

C0mpl3xP@ss!234

Generated by a password manager

🧰 Best Practices for Enforcing Strong Passwords
Practice	Description
🔐 Minimum length	Enforce at least 12–16 characters
⚙️ Complexity	Require mix of letters, digits, symbols
🧠 Education	Train users on building strong passwords
🧾 Regex validation	Use rules like:
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&]).{12,}$
🔄 Rotation	Regularly prompt users to update passwords
🔑 MFA	Add multi-factor authentication
💼 Password managers	Recommend secure tools (Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.)

🧪 Example Scenario
Scenario	Password	Result
Weak Policy	password123	✅ Cracked in seconds
Strong Policy	G7$k9@Lm2PqR	❌ Resists dictionary & brute-force attacks

🧠 Conclusion
Weak password policies create easy entry points for attackers.

Strong passwords greatly reduce risk of unauthorized access.

Combining strong passwords with MFA and user education is the most effective strategy.
